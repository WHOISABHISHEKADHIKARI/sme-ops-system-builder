# Sales Accounting

**What it is:** Sales invoices, the receivables they create, and the documents that support them.

## Overview

Works out the smallest useful **Sales Accounting** setup for the business in front of it, then
builds it only when asked. The default output is a short recommendation, not a
spreadsheet. Artifacts - CSV, SQL DDL, JSON Schema, Notion mapping - are produced on
request, from one field list so they cannot drift apart.

**Scope of one row.** This is a single-table skill and one row is one invoice carrying
**one line item**. It is deliberately not a multi-line billing engine. An invoice with
several items either becomes several rows that repeat the same `Invoice Number`, or is
kept in a separate line table alongside this one - whichever the business actually needs.
Decide that in Step 2, do not assume it.

**Everything is conditional.** Not every sale is on credit, not every invoice has an order
or a challan, not every sale attracts VAT, and not every customer deducts TDS. Those fields
exist to record what was confirmed; they are left unset when the answer is "not applicable"
or "not known". Never fill them with a default to make the row look complete.

Layer: Layer 3: Record. Fits: Starter stage. Table code: n/a.

## When to Use This Skill

- sales accounting
- sales invoice register
- customer billing and receivable tracker
- sales vat register log

Also use it when the user describes invoicing, billing or tracking who has paid, or the same
process happening in a spreadsheet, a document or someone's inbox.

Do not use it for: customer collections, tax filing, or legal advice. This skill produces
empty templates only - it never holds or processes real customer or financial data.

## How It Works

### Step 1 - Identify intent

Read the request and pick the intent before asking anything.

- "set up" or "build" or "create" -> the user wants artifacts; go to Step 2.
- "our process is ..." or "it is in a sheet" -> the user wants to move an existing process; capture it, then Step 2.
- "is this right" or "review" or "audit" -> the user wants a check, not a build; answer from what they share.
- "how do I ..." -> advice question; answer directly and offer the build only if it helps.

Then read everything the user has already said and work out which single missing answer
would actually change the recommendation. If the request already contains enough to
recommend, do not ask anything yet - go to Step 4. If the user is describing a problem
rather than requesting a build, answer it first; a question is not owed.

Never open with a fixed question such as "How are sales invoices raised today?" when the
request has already answered it.

### Step 2 - Ask only what is missing

Skip anything the user already answered, in any earlier message. Ask the rest one at a
time, and stop as soon as the remaining answers would not change the output.

- **Volume** - How many invoices a month? / Roughly how many lines per invoice?
- **Documents** - Is there a sales order every time, or only for some customers? / Is a delivery challan used at all?
- **Taxes and credit** - Is VAT charged, and at what rate? / Do any customers deduct TDS, and at what rate? / How many sales are on credit? / Standard credit period? / Who follows up?
- **Current process** - Tracked now? / Software or sheet? / What gets missed?
- **Outcome** - What do you need? / A sales register, an aging view or both?

Never invent an answer. If the user does not know, record it as unknown and carry on.

### Step 3 - Build the internal context

Hold the answers in this shape. It stays internal - it is not shown to the user unless
they ask, and it never carries a value the user did not give.

```yaml
module: sales-accounting
intent: null            # set in Step 1, one of: set up, fix, review, report, import
scale: null             # Starter | Growth | Scale, only if the answer changes it
areas:
  "Volume": null
  "Documents": null
  "Taxes and credit": null
  "Current process": null
  "Outcome": null
requested_outputs: []   # csv | sql | json | notion - only what was explicitly asked for
confirmed_facts: []     # only what the user actually said
open_questions: []      # the unanswered ones, in the order worth asking
```

### Step 4 - Recommend the smallest workflow

Give a short recommendation, then ask whether to build it. Do not build unprompted. Use
conditional language and name what is conditional.

**Recommended approach:** One invoice register, one row per invoice with a single line item.
Link the sales order, delivery challan and source document only where the business actually
raises them. Record VAT and TDS rates only where they were confirmed. For credit sales, add
the credit terms, due date, amount received, balance, a payment status and an aging status;
leave those unset for cash sales.

**Why this one:** A sales register that stops at the invoice total loses the receivable.
Splitting payment state from aging state is what turns billing into a collections list -
"paid" and "overdue" are different questions and one field cannot answer both.

**Workflow:** Documents prepared (where used) → Invoice issued → VAT register updated (where VAT applies) → Recorded → Receivable confirmed against the debtor ledger

### Step 5 - Build only on request

Once the user asks for it, derive the fields from the confirmed context and emit the
artifacts as data only. No preamble, no summary, no closing line.

The SQL below is written in PostgreSQL-flavoured DDL. `SERIAL PRIMARY KEY` and
`TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()` are PostgreSQL-specific; on another engine use that engine's
identity column and default-timestamp syntax. `created_at` and `updated_at` are maintained
by the database and are not business fields - leave them out of the CSV, JSON Schema and
Notion mapping.

The table above is the single source of truth. The CSV, SQL, JSON Schema and Notion mapping
are all derived from it - never edit one without the others.

How the amounts relate, so a reviewer can check any row:

- `Gross Amount` = `Quantity` x `Rate`
- `Taxable Value` = `Gross Amount` - `Discount`
- `Invoice Total` = `Taxable Value` + `VAT Amount` (equals `Taxable Value` when no VAT applies)
- `Net Receivable` = `Invoice Total` - `TDS Amount` (equals `Invoice Total` when no TDS applies)
- `Balance` = `Net Receivable` - `Amount Received`
- `Due Date` = `Invoice Date` + `Credit Terms (Days)`; both stay unset on a cash sale

`VAT Rate %`, `VAT Amount`, `TDS Rate %`, `TDS Amount`, `Credit Terms (Days)` and
`Due Date` are optional. Set them only from a confirmed answer, and never carry a rate as a
universal default - a TDS rate belongs to a specific customer, contract and jurisdiction,
and VAT applicability is a fact about the business and the supply.

`Payment Status` is what has been received: `Unpaid`, `Part Paid`, `Paid`, `Written Off`.
`Aging Status` is how late it is against `Due Date`: `Current`, `Due Soon`, `Overdue`,
assessed as at the reporting date. They are separate because an invoice can be fully paid
and no longer aging, or unpaid and long overdue.

`Sales Number` is the internal reference used inside the business; `Invoice Number` is the
number the customer is given. They are different things and both are useful, so both are
kept - but if the business only has one, drop `Sales Number` and keep the invoice number.
`Sales ID` is an internal database identifier only. It exists so the target database can
address a row, it is left blank in the example, and it is not a business reference - do not
print it on an invoice or quote it to a customer.

## Relations

Link fields: `Sales Order`, `Delivery Challan`, `Source Document`

All three are optional. Many invoices carry none of them, and a cash sale usually carries
none. Leave the cell unset rather than inventing a reference.

- `Sales Order` -> the sales order database. Links to the order this invoice was raised
  against, where the business raises orders at all.
- `Delivery Challan` -> the delivery challan database. Links to the challan evidencing
  despatch, where the business issues them at all.
- `Source Document` -> the source document filing register (`source-document-filing`).
  Links to the filed invoice and its supporting papers.

Each is a genuine link to a named database, not a typed reference. If the business does not
run that register, keep the field as `text` and say so, rather than labelling plain text a
relation.

## Examples

**Prompt**

```
We issue credit invoices and nobody can tell which customers have actually paid.
```

**Context first** - one question per message, nothing already answered:

> **Q:** Roughly how many lines does one invoice usually carry?
> **A:** Usually one, sometimes two.
>
> **Q:** Do you always raise an order and a challan?
> **A:** Order only for bigger customers. No challan at all.
>
> **Q:** Is VAT charged, and do any customers deduct TDS?
> **A:** VAT yes. TDS only two customers, different rates.

**Recommended next step** - offered, not built:

> Based on what you have confirmed: one invoice register, one row per invoice. Because most
> of your invoices carry a single line, this stays a single table; for the two-item invoices,
> either add a second row repeating the invoice number or keep a separate line table - tell me
> which, and the build follows that choice.
>
> Sales order links only where you raise one, so that field is optional. No challan field is
> worth carrying since you do not issue them - say the word and it comes out.
>
> VAT applies, so the rate and amount are recorded. TDS stays optional, recorded per customer
> at whatever rate that customer actually deducts, rather than a fixed rate.
>
> For your credit sales, credit terms, due date, amount received and balance, plus a payment
> status and a separate aging status - paid and overdue are different questions.
>
> Workflow: Order raised where needed → Invoice issued → VAT register updated → Recorded → Receivable confirmed against the debtor ledger
>
> Want the CSV, SQL DDL, JSON Schema and Notion mapping for this?

## Best Practices

- Recommend before building. The recommendation is the product; the files are the follow-up.
- One question per message. A batched intake reads as a form and gets guessed at.
- Skip any question the request has already answered. Asking it anyway costs trust.
- Keep payment state and aging state in separate fields. Collapsing them loses the
  collections view.
- Leave conditional fields unset when the answer is "not applicable" or "not known". A
  plausible default is worse than an empty cell, because nobody can tell it apart from fact.
- Record a tax rate only when it was confirmed for that customer or supply, never as a
  standing default.
- Keep every field name identical across CSV, SQL and JSON Schema.
- Use `relation` for anything that genuinely points at another table, `text` only for free text.
- Money fields are `currency`, never `text`. Dates are `date`, never free text.
- Keep the example row obviously fake so nobody imports it as real data.

## Limitations

- One row is one invoice with a single line item. Multi-line invoices need repeated invoice
  numbers or a separate line table; this skill does not model line-level tax or discounts.
- Empty template only. It does not compute tax, file returns or keep ledgers.
- Does not raise or send invoices, collect money, execute accounting entries, or call any
  external API. The surrounding platform decides whether such tools exist.
- Not legal or tax advice, and not a substitute for it. Confirm applicability with a
  qualified adviser for the jurisdiction in question.
- Notion relations need both databases imported before the link column resolves.
- Select options are a starting set. Rename them to match how the business talks.
- No automation, reminders or sync. Those need the integration layer.
- `Sales ID` is a database identifier, not a business reference.

## Security & Safety Notes

- Never fill in real customer names, tax identifiers, bank details or any real financial
  data. Placeholders only.
- This is a sales and receivables skill: it has no employee, payroll, leave or medical data
  and should not be asked to hold any.
- Keep bank details masked and never mark an example row `Confidential`.
- This skill writes nothing outside the chat. It runs no commands and calls no APIs unless
  the surrounding platform explicitly provides them.
- If the user pastes real customer or financial data, generate the template and tell them to
  delete the pasted data from the conversation.
- Anything that becomes a tax or legal filing needs a qualified human reviewer.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Problem:** asked all six questions in one message.
  **Solution:** ask one, wait, and drop any the first answer already covered.
- **Problem:** opened with "how are sales invoices raised today?" when the user had already
  described the process.
  **Solution:** read the request first; ask only what would change the recommendation.
- **Problem:** one status field carrying both "paid" and "overdue".
  **Solution:** split them - `Payment Status` for what was received, `Aging Status` for
  how late it is.
- **Problem:** every row shows a TDS rate, so nobody can tell which invoices actually had it.
  **Solution:** leave it unset unless it was confirmed for that customer.
- **Problem:** credit terms and due date filled in on a cash sale.
  **Solution:** those fields are optional; a cash sale leaves them empty.
- **Problem:** a single table silently truncating a two-item invoice.
  **Solution:** settle the line question in Step 2 - repeated rows or a line table.
- **Problem:** built a full system when one table was asked for.
  **Solution:** build what was requested; mention the parent skill separately.
- **Problem:** all four artifacts drift apart.
  **Solution:** derive all four from the Field Reference, never by hand.
- **Problem:** Notion import shows every column as Text.
  **Solution:** that is expected. Apply the property mapping table once, after import.

## Reusable Prompt

```
I want to set up sales invoices and the receivables they create for my company.
Ask me one short question at a time, and only about what I have not already told you.
Then recommend the smallest setup that fits, and wait for me to ask before you build it.
When I ask, output CSV, SQL DDL, JSON Schema and a Notion property mapping. Data only.
```
