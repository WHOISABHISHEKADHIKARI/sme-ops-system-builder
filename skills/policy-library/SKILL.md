# Policy Library

**What it is:** Company policies.

## Overview

Works out the smallest useful **Policy Library** setup for the business in front of it, then
builds it only when asked. The default output is a short recommendation, not a
spreadsheet. Artifacts - CSV, SQL DDL, JSON Schema, Notion mapping - are produced on
request, from one field list so they cannot drift apart.

Layer: Layer 1: Foundation. Fits: Starter stage. Table code: n/a.

## When to Use This Skill

- company policy template
- policy register
- hr policy database
- policy document library

Also use it when the user says "company policies", or describes the same process happening in a
spreadsheet, a document or someone inboxes.

Do not use it for: payroll calculation, tax filing, or legal advice. This skill produces
empty templates only - it never holds or processes real employee or customer data.

## How It Works

### Step 1 - Identify intent

Read the request and pick the intent before asking anything.

- "set up" or "build" or "create" -> the user wants artifacts; go to Step 2.
- "our process is ..." or "it is in a sheet" -> the user wants to move an existing process; capture it, then Step 2.
- "is this right" or "review" or "audit" -> the user wants a check, not a build; answer from what they share.
- "how do I ..." -> advice question; answer directly and offer the build only if it helps.

One message, one question, no batching. Open with:

> **Q:** Which policies exist today?

### Step 2 - Ask only what is missing

Skip anything the user already answered, in any earlier message. Ask the rest one at a
time, and stop as soon as the remaining answers would not change the output.

- **Policies** - Which policies exist? / Which are missing? / Company specific or generic?
- **Ownership** - Who approves each? / Who owns each? / Legal review needed?
- **Lifecycle** - Effective dates? / Review cycle? / Version history kept?
- **Current process** - Where do policies live now? / Shared drive or scattered? / Which are current?
- **Outcome** - What do you need? / A register, templates or both?

Never invent an answer. If the user does not know, record it as unknown and carry on.

### Step 3 - Hold the internal context

Hold the answers in this shape. It stays internal - it is not shown to the user unless
they ask, and it never carries a value the user did not give.

```yaml
module: policy-library
intent: null            # set in Step 1, one of: set up, fix, review, report, import
scale: null             # Starter | Growth | Scale, only if the answer changes it
areas:
  "Policies": null
  "Ownership": null
  "Lifecycle": null
  "Current process": null
  "Outcome": null
requested_outputs: []   # csv | sql | json | notion - only what was explicitly asked for
confirmed_facts: []     # only what the user actually said
open_questions: []      # the unanswered ones, in the order worth asking
```

### Step 4 - Recommend the smallest workflow

Give a short recommendation, then ask whether to build it. Do not build unprompted. Ask: "Want me to build the CSV, SQL DDL, JSON Schema, Notion mapping, or an Excel workbook from these confirmed rules?"

**Recommended approach:** Build a register of policies with owner, version and review date. Write the missing policy drafts only for the ones you name.

**Why this one:** Most SMEs have policies in several places and no owner. A register with an owner and a review date makes the gap visible.

**Workflow:** Policy draft → Approve → Publish version → Assign → Review date

### Step 5 - Build only on request

Once the user asks for it, derive the fields from the confirmed context and emit the
artifacts as data only. No preamble, no summary, no closing line.

An Excel workbook is the CSV emitted with a UTF-8 byte order mark, so Excel opens it with
correct text and no import dialog. A CSV carries no types, so after it, name the columns
that need a number, date or currency format applied.

```csv
Policy Name,Acknowledgement Required,Applies To,Approver,Category,Compliance Framework,Effective Date,Next Review,Policy ID,Policy Owner,Status,Summary,Version,Acknowledgements
Code of Conduct,FALSE,All employees,Sneha Iyer,HR,ISO 27001,2026-01-15,2026-01-15,,Sneha Iyer,Published,"Code of conduct, version 2.1, reviewed in January.",v1.0,11
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE policy_library (
  policy_name VARCHAR(255),
  acknowledgement_required BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
  applies_to VARCHAR(255),
  approver VARCHAR(255),
  category VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,

  status VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  summary TEXT,

  acknowledgements NUMERIC NOT NULL,

  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_policy_library_status ON policy_library (status);

| Policy Name | Text | Leave as Text |
| Acknowledgement Required | Checkbox | Convert to Checkbox |
| Applies To | Text | Leave as Text |
| Approver | Text | Leave as Text |
| Category | Select (add options after import) | Convert to Select, add options: "HR", "Finance", "Security", "Safety", "Legal", "Operations" |
| Compliance Framework | Text | Leave as Text |
| Effective Date | Date | Convert to Date |
| Next Review | Date | Convert to Date |
| Policy ID | Text (or Notion auto-ID) | Delete the column and switch the primary column to auto-ID, or keep as Text |
| Policy Owner | Text | Leave as Text |
| Status | Select (add options after import) | Convert to Select, add options: "Draft", "In Review", "Published", "Under Revision", "Retired" |
| Summary | Text | Leave as Text |

One example row per artifact, visibly fake. Money stays `currency`, dates stay `date`,
and anything pointing at another table stays `relation`.

## Examples

**Prompt**

```
We have some HR policies in a folder and nothing else written down.
```

**Context first** - one question per message, nothing already answered:

> **Q:** Which are missing?
> **A:** Leave, expenses and remote work.
>
> **Q:** Who approves?
> **A:** The owner.
>
> **Q:** Review cycle?
> **A:** Every year.

**Recommended next step** - offered, not built:

> Build a register of policies with owner, version and review date. Write the missing policy drafts only for the ones you name.
>
> Workflow: Policy draft → Approve → Publish version → Assign → Review date
>
> Want the CSV, SQL, JSON Schema and Notion mapping for this?

## Best Practices

- Recommend before building. The recommendation is the product; the files are the follow-up.
- One question per message. A batched intake reads as a form and gets guessed at.
- Keep every field name identical across CSV, SQL and JSON Schema.
- Use `relation` for anything that points at another table, `text` only for free text.
- Money fields are `currency`, never `text`. Dates are `date`, never free text.
- Keep the example row obviously fake so nobody imports it as real data.

## Limitations

- Empty template only. It does not compute payroll, tax, leave balances or KPIs.
- Notion relations need both databases imported before the link column resolves.
- Select options are a starting set. Rename them to match how the business talks.
- No automation, reminders or sync. Those need the integration layer.
- Does not provide legal templates or jurisdiction-specific wording.
- Legal, tax and HR review is still required before this drives real decisions.

## Security & Safety Notes

- Never fill in real names, salaries, medical or banking data. Placeholders only.
- Never mark an example row `Confidential`, and keep bank details masked.
- This skill writes nothing outside the chat. It runs no commands and calls no APIs.
- If the user pastes real employee data, generate the template and tell them to delete
  the pasted data from the conversation.
- Privacy, legal and disciplinary cases need a qualified human reviewer before anything
  is acted on.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Problem:** asked all six questions in one message.
  **Solution:** ask one, wait, and drop any the first answer already covered.
- **Problem:** built a full system when one table was asked for.
  **Solution:** build what was requested; mention the parent skill separately.
- **Problem:** all four artifacts drift apart.
  **Solution:** derive all four from the field list in this file, never by hand.
- **Problem:** Notion import shows every column as Text.
  **Solution:** that is expected. Apply the property mapping table once, after import.

## Reusable Prompt

```
I want to set up company policies for my company.
Ask me one short question at a time, and only about what I have not already told you.
Then recommend the smallest setup that fits, and wait for me to ask before you build it.
When I ask, output CSV, SQL DDL, JSON Schema, a Notion property mapping or an Excel workbook. Data only.
```
