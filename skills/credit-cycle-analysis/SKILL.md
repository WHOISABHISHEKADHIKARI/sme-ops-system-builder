# Debtor & Creditor Credit-Cycle Analysis

**What it is:** How long the business actually waits to be paid and how long it actually takes to pay, measured per party and per period.

## Overview

Works out the smallest useful **Debtor & Creditor Credit-Cycle Analysis** setup for the business in
front of it, then builds it only when asked. The default output is a short recommendation, not a
spreadsheet. Artifacts - CSV, SQL DDL, JSON Schema, Notion mapping - are produced on request, from
one field list so they cannot drift apart.

Layer: Layer 8: Close & Analyse. Fits: Growth stage. Table code: n/a.

**The SOP rule this skill is built around:** analyse debtors on the average collection period,
outstanding invoices, overdue receivables and the aging of receivables; analyse creditors on the
average payment period, outstanding supplier balances, overdue payables and supplier aging; then
compare the debtor collection cycle with the creditor payment cycle. The comparison is the point.
Two cycles measured the same way can be read against each other, and the day-to-day pressure of
waiting longer than you take is invisible as a line on the balance sheet. That pressure is
measured in **days** here. Turning it into money is a separate calculation with its own basis,
below.

**Six concepts that never stand in for each other.** This table exists to keep them apart, and
most of the wrong answers come from swapping one for another:

| Concept | What it answers | Field that carries it |
|---|---|---|
| Contractual terms | What was agreed | `Contractual Terms Days` |
| Actual cycle | What actually happened | `Actual Collection/Payment Days`, `Weighted Days` |
| Benchmark | What to compare against | `Benchmark Days`, `Gap vs Benchmark` |
| Aging | How old the unpaid items are | bucket amounts, and `Aging Bucket` on the invoice/bill detail |
| Debtor-vs-creditor timing | Which side of the cycle is longer | `Cycle Gap Days` on the comparison record |
| Working-capital funding | What the timing difference costs in money | `Estimated Working-Capital Funding`, `Calculation Basis` |

Conflating them is the defect this module is built to prevent. Contractual terms of 30 days and
an actual collection cycle of 42 days are two facts about the same party, and the 42 is the one
that reaches the bank account. Writing the 30 into `Actual Collection/Payment Days` because it is
the number in the contract is a substituted value, not a measurement.

**Aging lives on the invoice, not on the party.** One party can hold open invoices in several
aging buckets on the same day. So the party-period record carries the bucket **amounts**
(`Current Amount`, `Aging 0-30 Amount`, `Aging 31-60 Amount`, `Aging 61-90 Amount`, `Aging 91-180 Amount`, `Aging Over 180 Amount`)
and the single `Aging Bucket` belongs to one invoice or one bill on the aging-detail record. A
party row carrying one `Aging Bucket` cannot describe a real aging position and is replaced by
the bucket amounts.

**Neutral field names.** The two movement fields are `Credit Movement` and `Settlement`, for
customers and for suppliers alike. `Credit Movement` is the credit-side activity that created the
balance in the period - customer invoices on the debtor side, supplier bills on the creditor
side. `Settlement` is what closed it - customer collections, supplier payments. A name like
`Total Billed` describes only the debtor side and quietly makes the creditor side unreadable.

**The balance identity, and what happens when it fails.**

```
Closing Balance = Opening Balance + Credit Movement - Settlement +/- Adjustments
```

Check it on every row. If it does not hold, the difference is **recorded and marked**, never
repaired by editing a component. A silently balanced row is worse than an unbalanced one,
because the next period inherits it.

**The cycle gap is descriptive, not a verdict.**

```
Cycle Gap Days = Debtor Collection Days - Creditor Payment Days
```

Positive means customers take longer to pay than the business takes to pay suppliers. Zero means
the two measured cycles are equal. Negative means suppliers are paid later than customers are
collected. A positive gap is not automatically bad - it is often the ordinary consequence of
selling on credit to a customer base and buying on shorter terms. The module states the
difference and leaves the judgement to the business.

**Working-capital funding needs a monetary basis, and the basis is always written down.**

```
Estimated Working-Capital Funding = Cycle Gap Days x Relevant Daily Credit Movement
```

This is only computed when the relevant monetary basis exists, and `Calculation Basis` always
records how that basis was built. A plausible daily figure is:

```
Relevant Daily Credit Movement = Relevant annual credit movement / 365
```

and it is only used when the selected annual movement is appropriate for the analysis. Where the
monetary basis is missing, `Estimated Working-Capital Funding` is `Unknown` and the record says so.
Never invent a monetary impact, and never divide a period's movement by 365 without checking that
the period is the year the analysis is about.

**Benchmarks are the user's, not the module's.** `Gap vs Benchmark` is `Actual Collection/Payment
Days - Benchmark Days`. A benchmark must be supplied by the user, explicitly selected by the
user, or clearly labelled a proposed default. It is never presented as a business target, and
never as an industry figure unless the user supplied that figure.

**Due dates are recorded, never derived.** `Days Overdue = Period End - Due Date`. Where a due date
is not recorded, the aging is `Unknown` - a due date is never reconstructed from payment terms,
because terms are an agreement and the due date is a fact about one invoice.

**Percentages, money and rounding.** A percentage is stored as `97` for 97%, never `0.97`, and the
convention is never mixed inside the table. Money is a bare number with no currency symbol in the
cell, and the currency itself is `Unknown` until the user states it. Amounts are the gross ledger
amounts as posted to the party's account, tax-inclusive; this module does not split tax out of a
balance. Every figure is rounded once, at the end, to two decimal places, so the components can be
re-derived from the row.

## When to Use This Skill

- debtor collection analysis
- creditor payment analysis
- receivables aging and payables aging
- average collection period or average payment period
- customer payment behaviour and supplier payment behaviour
- working-capital cycle review
- converting an existing credit-cycle spreadsheet or process

Also use it when the user says "how long the business actually waits to be paid and how long it
actually takes to pay, measured per party", or describes the same process happening in a
spreadsheet, a document or someone inboxes.

Do not use it for: collections chasing, credit-control action plans, payment execution, banking
operations, employee analysis, disciplinary decisions, or legal advice. This skill designs
templates and analysis structures. It does not execute financial transactions, and it produces
empty templates only - it never holds or processes real customer or supplier data.

## How It Works

Follow the [shared execution contract](../../references/execution-contract.md). The module-specific rules below define only domain fields, decisions, calculations, and safety constraints.

### Step 1 - Identify intent

Read the request and pick the intent before asking anything.

- "set up" or "build" or "create" -> the user wants artifacts; go to Step 2.
- "our process is ..." or "we have a sheet" -> `import` or `fix`; capture what is there, then Step 2.
- "is this right" or "review this" or "audit this" -> `review`; answer from what they share and do
  not rebuild anything.
- "show me the cycle" or "analyse this" -> `report`; answer from what they share.
- "how do I ..." -> advice question; answer directly and offer the build only if it helps.

If the intent is already clear from the request, do not ask the user to repeat it.

On a `review`, check the design against nine things and report concrete issues with concrete
fixes: the data model, the calculation logic, the reconciliation, the aging, debtor/creditor
comparability, the benchmark logic, the working-capital methodology, the data quality, and whether
the four artifacts agree. Do not rebuild the system because a review was asked for.

On a `fix`, preserve every valid fact the user has already supplied, identify the contradictions,
correct the model, avoid fields that were not asked for, and explain the material changes briefly.
Rebuild the artifacts only when the fix request asks for them.

One message, one question, no batching. Open with the question that decides the design:

> **Q:** How long do your customers take to pay you?

### Step 2 - Ask only what is missing

Treat ambiguous replies as unanswered and ask which explicit option the user means. Record unknown values as `Unknown`; `Unknown` is not zero. A record must not be `Done` when a required check fails.

Skip anything the user already answered, in any earlier message. Ask the rest one at a time, and
stop as soon as the remaining answers would not change the recommendation or the requested
artifact. Never batch two questions into one message.

- **Parties** - Are customers included? Are suppliers included? How many of each? Are parties
  tracked individually? Is a customer credit limit maintained for anyone?
- **Cycle, customers** - What are the contractual payment terms in days? What does the customer
  cycle actually measure? Which dates does the business already hold? Do part-payments happen?
- **Cycle, suppliers** - Same four questions, asked separately. Do not assume the customer answer
  carries over to the supplier side.
- **Measurement basis** - Is the cycle measured from invoice/bill date to settlement date, to
  first settlement date, from due date to settlement date, or on a weighted settlement date?
  Select a basis only from evidence in the user's process, never by default.
- **Aging** - Do invoice or bill dates exist? Do due dates exist? Are outstanding amounts
  available? Can aging be done at invoice or bill level? Which buckets are already in use?
- **Current process** - Spreadsheet, accounting software, manual, or an existing report? How is it
  reconciled today? What data-quality problem is known?
- **Outcome** - Cycle measurement, aging, the debtor-vs-creditor comparison, working-capital
  analysis, or all of them?

**An ambiguous answer is not an answer.** `yes`, `no`, `maybe`, `same`, `okay` and `fine` do not
answer a multiple-choice question. Re-ask as an explicit choice:

> **Q:** Which do you mean: **the days you agreed in writing** or **the days you actually wait**?

A partial answer keeps only the part that was answered. "Customers take somewhere between thirty
and fifty days" records a range for the actual cycle and leaves the contractual terms `Unknown`.

**Never invent a business fact.** Not a party name, a balance, an invoice number, a payment date,
a due date, a payment term, a credit limit, a benchmark, a currency, a collection day, a payment
day, an aging figure, a working-capital amount or a trend. If a value was not supplied by the user
or derived by a documented formula from supplied data, it is `Unknown` or blank.
Never turn Unknown into zero - a blank is an answer about what is missing, a zero is an answer
about the business. Record `Unknown`, move on, and never re-ask an unknown the user has already
said they do not have.

When the answer to a question is genuinely `Unknown`, the calculated values that depend on it stay
`Unknown` too, and the row's `Data Quality Status` records why. `Actual Collection/Payment Days`
is never filled with the contractual terms, and `Estimated Working-Capital Funding` is never
filled with a number when the monetary basis is missing.

### Step 3 - Hold the internal context

Hold the answers in this shape. It stays internal - it is not shown to the user unless they ask,
and it never carries a value the user did not give.

```yaml
module: credit-cycle-analysis
intent: null            # set in Step 1, one of: set up, fix, review, report, import
scale: null             # Starter | Growth | Scale, only if the answer changes it
areas:
  "Parties": null
  "Cycle": null
  "Aging": null
  "Current process": null
  "Outcome": null
debtor_terms_days: null
debtor_actual_days: null
debtor_measurement_basis: null
creditor_terms_days: null
creditor_actual_days: null
creditor_measurement_basis: null
partial_payments: null
credit_limits_maintained: null
due_dates_available: null
invoice_level_aging: null
aging_buckets: null
annualised_basis_appropriate: null
requested_outputs: []   # csv | sql | json | notion - only what was explicitly asked for
confirmed_facts: []     # only what the user actually said
unknowns: []            # asked and not answered
open_questions: []      # the unanswered ones, in the order worth asking
```

### Step 4 - Recommend the smallest workflow

Give a short recommendation, then ask whether to build it. Do not build unprompted.

**Recommended approach:** Three logical datasets, kept apart. A party-period credit-cycle summary in
the same shape for debtors and for creditors; an invoice/bill aging detail carrying the evidence
and the buckets; and a per-period debtor-versus-creditor comparison where the gap and, if a
monetary basis exists, the funding effect are recorded.

**Why this one:** The three layers do three different jobs and conflating any two of them is what
produces a wrong number. The summary is the management view. The detail is the evidence behind
every aging bucket and behind every day count, and it is the only place a single `Aging Bucket`
can honestly sit. The comparison is the only place the two sides can be subtracted at all, and it
is the only place a monetary basis is recorded. Forcing all of it into one row is what makes a
party's aging position unrepresentable.

**Workflow:** Party selected → Period movement recorded as credit movement and settlement →
Cycle days measured on the documented basis → Overdue and bucket amounts reviewed → Compared
against the other side → Gap priced only if a monetary basis exists → Trend recorded → Reconciled,
marked and reviewed

### Step 5 - Build only on request

Once the user asks for it, derive the fields from one canonical field dictionary and emit the
artifacts as data only. No preamble, no summary, no closing line. A field present in one artifact
is present in all four, in the same order. Build only what was asked for: CSV, SQL, JSON Schema and
Notion mapping on request, and one of them if that is all that was asked for.

**Notion needs a connected workspace first.** When the user selects Notion as the
output, emit the connection prerequisite from the
[shared execution contract](../../references/execution-contract.md) verbatim before
the Notion mapping, then stop and wait for the reply "Notion connected." If the user
would rather not connect, emit the mapping as text, add one line saying it is
unverified until the workspace is connected, and offer
[notion-manual-import](../notion-manual-import/SKILL.md) for the full manual path.
Never claim a connection exists, and never ask for a Notion password or token.

`required` is a business-necessity list, not an availability list. `Opening Balance`,
`Credit Movement`, `Settlement` and `Closing Balance` are required because the balance identity
cannot be tested without all four. `Period Start` and `Period End` are required because every
other date on the row is measured against the period. `Party Type` is required because the
customer-only fields are only meaningful with it. Every calculated field - the days, the bucket
amounts, the credit limit, the utilisation, the benchmark and the gap - is deliberately optional,
because each of them has a legitimate `Unknown`.

### Dataset 2 - Invoice/Bill Aging Detail

One record per invoice or supplier bill, and the only place a single `Aging Bucket` belongs. Its
CSV header is the Field column below in order; its JSON Schema mirrors the SQL column; its Notion
mapping mirrors the Notion column. Where the business already uses its own buckets, keep the
business's buckets and rename the columns to match rather than forcing these.

| Field | Type | SQL | JSON Schema | Notion |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Aging Detail ID | `id` | `SERIAL PRIMARY KEY` | `integer` | Text (or Notion auto-ID) |
| Party Type | `select` | `VARCHAR(100)` | `string` | Select (add options after import) |
| Party Name | `text` | `VARCHAR(255)` | `string` | Text |
| Invoice/Bill Number | `text` | `VARCHAR(255)` | `string` | Text |
| Invoice/Bill Date | `date` | `DATE` | `string, format: date` | Date |
| Due Date | `date` | `DATE` | `string, format: date` | Date |
| Original Amount | `currency` | `NUMERIC(14,2)` | `number` | Number (format: currency) |
| Settled Amount | `currency` | `NUMERIC(14,2)` | `number` | Number (format: currency) |
| Outstanding Amount | `currency` | `NUMERIC(14,2)` | `number` | Number (format: currency) |
| Settlement Date | `date` | `DATE` | `string, format: date` | Date |
| Days Overdue | `number` | `NUMERIC` | `number` | Number |
| Aging Bucket | `select` | `VARCHAR(100)` | `string` | Select (add options after import) |
| Period End | `date` | `DATE` | `string, format: date` | Date |
| Notes | `long_text` | `TEXT` | `string` | Text |

`Party Type` options as above. `Aging Bucket` starting set: `Current`, `0-30 days`, `31-60 days`,
`61-90 days`, `91-180 days`, `180+ days`, `Unknown`.

`Days Overdue = Period End - Due Date`. Zero or negative is `Current`; 1-30 is `0-30 days`; 31-60
is `31-60 days`; 61-90 is `61-90 days`; 91-180 is `91-180 days`; 181 and above is `180+ days`. A
`Due Date` that is not recorded leaves `Days Overdue` and `Aging Bucket` as `Unknown`. Do not guess
a due date from payment terms - a term is the agreement, the due date is a fact about this
invoice, and reconstructing it produces an aging profile that looks measured and is not.

`Outstanding Amount = Original Amount - Settled Amount`. Where a part-payment has been received,
`Settlement Date` is the date of the **final** settlement and the day count is the weighted
settlement calculation below.

```sql
-- Engine assumption: PostgreSQL, as above.

  aging_detail_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,

  invoice_bill_date DATE,
  due_date DATE,
  original_amount NUMERIC(14,2),
  settled_amount NUMERIC(14,2),
  outstanding_amount NUMERIC(14,2),
  settlement_date DATE,
  days_overdue NUMERIC,
  aging_bucket VARCHAR(100),
  period_end DATE,
  notes TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),

  CONSTRAINT credit_cycle_aging_money_non_negative CHECK (
    original_amount >= 0
    AND settled_amount >= 0
    AND outstanding_amount >= 0)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_credit_cycle_aging_detail_bucket ON credit_cycle_aging_detail (aging_bucket);
```

### Dataset 3 - Working-Capital Comparison

One record per reporting period, and the only place the two sides are subtracted. Its CSV header
is the Field column below in order; its JSON Schema mirrors the SQL column; its Notion mapping
mirrors the Notion column.

| Field | Type | SQL | JSON Schema | Notion |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Comparison ID | `id` | `SERIAL PRIMARY KEY` | `integer` | Text (or Notion auto-ID) |
| Period Start | `date` | `DATE` | `string, format: date` | Date |
| Period End | `date` | `DATE` | `string, format: date` | Date |
| Debtor Collection Days | `number` | `NUMERIC` | `number` | Number |
| Creditor Payment Days | `number` | `NUMERIC` | `number` | Number |
| Cycle Gap Days | `number` | `NUMERIC` | `number` | Number |
| Relevant Daily Credit Movement | `currency` | `NUMERIC(14,2)` | `number` | Number (format: currency) |

`Data Quality Status`, `Cycle Trend` and `Status` take the option lists above.

`Cycle Gap Days = Debtor Collection Days - Creditor Payment Days`, read descriptively only. A
positive gap is not automatically bad; the module does not call it bad, and it does not recommend
a change of terms, a change of supplier or a new facility. `Cycle Gap Days` and
`Estimated Working-Capital Funding` are both optional, because either side of the comparison can
legitimately be `Unknown`.

`Estimated Working-Capital Funding = Cycle Gap Days x Relevant Daily Credit Movement` **only** when
a monetary basis exists. `Calculation Basis` is never optional on a row that carries the estimate,
and it names the basis in words - for example "relevant annual credit movement divided by 365",
together with which annual figure was chosen and why. With no monetary basis, the estimate is
`Unknown` and `Calculation Basis` says why.

### How the day counts are calculated

Every calculated cycle metric states its source dates, its formula, its settlement treatment, its
partial-payment treatment, and whether it is exact or estimated. `Measurement Basis` on the
summary row and `Notes` on the detail row are where that record lives.

**Actual cycle, preferred invoice-level basis:**

```
Actual Days = Settlement Date - Invoice/Bill Date
```

**Partial payments.** Where an invoice is settled in more than one payment, use the weighted
settlement calculation and record that this is what was used:

```
Weighted Settlement Date =
  SUM (Settled Amount_i x Settlement Date_i) / SUM (Settled Amount_i)

Weighted Days = Weighted Settlement Date - Invoice/Bill Date
```

`Weighted Days` on the party-period row is the average of the invoice-level weighted day counts
for that party in that period, and `Measurement Basis` says so. The plain
`Actual Collection/Payment Days` on the same row is the unweighted mean, and it is left `Unknown`
where the weighted figure is the one that was calculated. Both figures on one row, with the basis
named, is the honest answer; a single number that is quietly one or the other is not.

Where the business uses a different documented basis, that basis is used instead - and it is
written into `Measurement Basis`. The basis is never assumed.

**Where the required dates do not exist**, `Actual Collection/Payment Days` is `Unknown`. It is not
filled with the contractual terms, and it is not filled with zero.

**Trend.** `Cycle Trend` compares the current actual cycle with the previous comparable period.
Starting set: `Improving`, `Stable`, `Deteriorating`, `Unknown`. With no comparable prior period
the value is `Unknown`. A trend is never inferred from a single period, and a direction is never
assigned because the number looks uncomfortable.

**Reconciliation and data quality, before a record is complete.** Check the balance identity; check
`Period Start` is not after `Period End`; check that the dates each calculated cycle metric needs
actually exist; check that due dates exist for every line being aged; check that the monetary
values are valid; check that part-settlements are handled rather than ignored; check that the
debtor and creditor cycles were measured on comparable definitions; check that a customer
utilisation figure has a customer credit limit behind it; check that any working-capital funding
figure has a documented monetary basis. Record the outcome:

```
Reconciliation Status: Reconciled | Needs Review | Unreconciled | Unknown
Data Quality Status:    Complete | Incomplete | Needs Review | Blocked
Status:                 Not started | In progress | Blocked | Done | Cancelled
```

A record must not be `Done` while a required reconciliation or calculation check fails. A
difference is recorded and marked, never corrected to make the row tie out. Missing information is
never represented as zero.

`Measurement Basis` is in this list because the day counts above it cannot be interpreted without
it, and because the reviewer's first question - actual behaviour or agreed terms - only has an
answer if the basis is written on the row. `Customer Credit Limit` and `Customer Credit
Utilisation %` are **customer-only**: they are filled only where `Party Type` is
`Customer/Debtor` and a credit limit actually exists. On a `Supplier/Creditor` row both stay
blank. A supplier has no customer credit limit, and writing one there is a category error, not a
default. Where no limit exists, `Customer Credit Utilisation %` is `Unknown`, never `0`.

## Select Options

Every list below is a starting set, not the business's confirmed taxonomy. The user’s own
values win. In Notion, add the options after import.

**Party Type**

```
Customer/Debtor | Supplier/Creditor
```
**Cycle Trend**

```
Improving | Stable | Deteriorating | Unknown
```
**Reconciliation Status**

```
Reconciled | Needs Review | Unreconciled | Unknown
```
**Data Quality Status**

```
Complete | Incomplete | Needs Review | Blocked
```
**Status**

```
Not started | In progress | Blocked | Done | Cancelled
```

## Relations

No relation fields. This table is standalone: `Party Name` is free text because no party master
table is created by this build, and inventing a link to a database that does not exist would give
a column that never resolves. Where the business later wants a live party link, add it once the
party database actually exists.

## Examples

**Prompt**

```
We are profitable on paper but cash is always tight and we cannot say why.
```

**Context first** - one question per message, nothing already answered:

> **Q:** How long do your customers take to pay you?
> **A:** Terms are 30 days, but the big ones take about six weeks.
>
> **Q:** And how long do you take to pay your suppliers?
> **A:** Most of them are 45 days and they are strict about it.
>
> **Q:** Do you track any of it today?
> **A:** No. We just look at the bank balance and hope.

**Recommended next step** - offered, not built:

> Three datasets. A party-period credit-cycle summary in the same shape for debtors and for
> creditors; an invoice/bill aging detail carrying the evidence and the buckets; and a per-period
> debtor-versus-creditor comparison where the gap, and the funding effect only if a monetary basis
> exists, are recorded.
>
> Workflow: Party selected → Period movement recorded as credit movement and settlement → Cycle
> days measured on the documented basis → Overdue and bucket amounts reviewed → Compared against
> the other side → Gap priced only if a monetary basis exists → Trend recorded → Reconciled,
> marked and reviewed
>
> Want the CSV, SQL, JSON Schema and Notion mapping for this?

## Best Practices

- Recommend before building. The recommendation is the product; the files are the follow-up.
- One question per message. A batched intake reads as a form and gets guessed at.
- Ask the customer question and the supplier question separately. One answer about terms does not
  carry over to the other side.
- Keep the six concepts apart. Terms, actual, benchmark, aging, gap and funding are six different
  numbers and each has its own field.
- Never substitute terms for actual days, or a benchmark for a target, or a day count for a money
  amount. When the underlying data is missing, the answer is `Unknown`.
- Never put one `Aging Bucket` on a party row. The party row carries bucket amounts; the bucket
  itself belongs to an invoice or a bill.
- Name the two movement fields `Credit Movement` and `Settlement` so the same fields read correctly
  for customers and for suppliers.
- Test the balance identity before reading a single day figure off a row. A cycle measured on an
  unreconciled balance is precise and wrong.
- Record a difference, never repair one. `Adjustments` is where a real adjustment goes, with a
  reason; an unexplained break is left visible with a status.
- Write the basis into `Measurement Basis` and keep it stable across periods. Changing the basis
  mid-year makes the trend a measurement change, not a change in behaviour.
- Where part-payments happen, use the weighted settlement calculation above and say so. Taking the
  final payment date as if it settled the whole invoice understates every day count.
- A benchmark must be the user’s, explicitly chosen, or labelled a proposed default. Never present
  one as a business target.
- Convert days to money only with a recorded monetary basis, and record that basis every time.
- State the gap descriptively. This module measures the timing difference and does not decide
  whether it is acceptable.
- Keep every field name identical across CSV, SQL, JSON Schema and the Notion mapping, in the same
  order. A field that exists in one and not the others is a defect.
- Money fields are `currency`, never `text`. Dates are `date`, never free text. Days are numeric.
  Percentages are stored as `97` for 97%, never `0.97`.
- Round once, at the end, so the components re-derive the total.
- If the user requests an example row, keep it obviously fake so nobody imports it as real data.

## Limitations

- Empty templates only. It does not calculate collection periods, chase anyone, set a credit limit
  or recommend a change of terms. The days and the money on each row are the ones the business
  entered.
- It measures the gap; it does not close it and it does not judge it. Whether a positive gap is
  worth fixing is a commercial decision, not a record.
- A cycle measured from a ledger is only as good as the ledger. Reconcile the party balances
  first, or the days will be precise and wrong.
- Overdue amounts depend on due dates being recorded against every invoice. Where they are not,
  the aging bucket is `Unknown` and the row is not aged - a guessed due date is worse than none.
- `Estimated Working-Capital Funding` is an estimate on a stated basis, not a cash-flow forecast.
  It excludes retention, factoring, bill discounting, foreign currency settlement timing and any
  seasonality the annualised basis does not carry.
- Averages hide concentration. A party-period row is not evidence about how the total is
  distributed across parties; read the detail dataset for that.
- `Data Quality Status` is a judgement the module cannot make for you. It records the checks that
  were run and what they returned.
- Notion relations need both databases imported before a link column resolves; this module has no
  relation columns to worry about.
- Select options are a starting set. Rename them to match how the business talks.
- No automation, reminders or sync. Those need the integration layer.
- Legal, tax and HR review is still required before this drives real decisions.

## Security & Safety Notes

- Never fill in real customer or supplier names, balances, invoice numbers or bank details.
  Placeholders only.
- Never mark an example row `Confidential`, and keep bank and payment references masked.
- Creating a requested artifact may write that artifact locally. Do not run commands,
  call APIs, provision infrastructure, or make other external changes unless the user
  explicitly requests and authorizes them.
- If the user pastes a real ledger extract, generate the template and tell them to delete the
  pasted data from the conversation.
- A cycle analysis names customers and suppliers alongside how badly each one is paying. Treat it
  as commercially sensitive and keep it inside the finance function.
- Privacy, legal and disciplinary cases need a qualified human reviewer before anything is acted
  on.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Problem:** the Notion mapping is handed over with no workspace connected.
  **Solution:** the connection prerequisite goes first, and a mapping handed over as
  text is labelled unverified until the workspace is connected.
- **Problem:** asked all six questions in one message.
  **Solution:** ask one, wait, and drop any the first answer already covered.
- **Problem:** contractual terms were written into the actual collection days, so a 42 day cycle
  reported as 30.
  **Solution:** `Contractual Terms Days` and `Actual Collection/Payment Days` are separate fields.
  Where the dates do not exist, the actual figure is `Unknown`.
- **Problem:** one `Aging Bucket` sat on the party row and the aging position was wrong every time
  a party had two live invoices.
  **Solution:** a party holds several buckets at once. Bucket **amounts** go on the party-period
  row; the single `Aging Bucket` goes on the invoice/bill detail row.
- **Problem:** the common movement field was called `Total Billed`, so the creditor rows read as if
  suppliers were billed.
  **Solution:** the neutral names are `Credit Movement` and `Settlement` for both sides.
- **Problem:** the closing balance was nudged so the row would tie.
  **Solution:** record the difference, set `Reconciliation Status`, and leave the component alone.
  A forced tie is inherited by the next period and hides the break that caused it.
- **Problem:** a positive `Cycle Gap Days` was reported as a problem in a monthly note.
  **Solution:** the gap is descriptive. State the direction and the size and leave the judgement
  with the business.
- **Problem:** days were turned into money with no basis, and the number was quoted as a funding
  requirement.
  **Solution:** compute it only when the monetary basis exists, and always write `Calculation
  Basis` next to it.
- **Problem:** a credit limit and a utilisation percentage appeared on supplier rows.
  **Solution:** `Customer Credit Limit` and `Customer Credit Utilisation %` are customer-only.
  Leave both blank on a `Supplier/Creditor` row.
- **Problem:** a due date was reconstructed from the payment terms because the invoice had none.
  **Solution:** a missing due date is `Unknown`, and the row is not aged. Terms are an agreement,
  not a fact about the invoice.
- **Problem:** a benchmark was inserted from general knowledge and presented as the target.
  **Solution:** the benchmark is the user’s figure, explicitly selected, or labelled a proposed
  default. Nothing else.
- **Problem:** an invoice settled in three payments was dated from the last payment only.
  **Solution:** use the weighted settlement calculation, and record in `Measurement Basis` that it
  was used.
- **Problem:** a trend was assigned on the strength of one period.
  **Solution:** `Cycle Trend` is `Unknown` without a comparable prior period.
- **Problem:** a calculated field was left blank with no status recorded, so the blank read as
  zero in the next report.
  **Solution:** a blank is `Unknown`, and `Data Quality Status` says why.
- **Problem:** the two cycles were measured differently and then compared.
  **Solution:** same period, same basis, same calculation. If the bases differ, the difference
  between the two cycles means nothing.
- **Problem:** a field existed in the CSV but not in the SQL, or was defined differently in the
  JSON Schema.
  **Solution:** derive all four from one field dictionary. A field that is in one artifact and
  missing or different in another is the defect.
- **Problem:** built a full system when one dataset was asked for.
  **Solution:** build what was requested and name the other two datasets as available.
- **Problem:** all four artifacts drift apart.
  **Solution:** derive all four from the field list in this file, never by hand.
- **Problem:** Notion import shows every column as Text.
  **Solution:** that is expected. Apply the property mapping table once, after import, and add the
  Select options then.

## Reusable Prompt

```
I want to set up a system for measuring how long my business waits to be paid by customers and
how long it takes to pay suppliers, measured per party and per period.

Ask me one short question per message, and only about what I have not already told you. Do not
assume that contractual payment terms are the same as actual payment behaviour, and never batch
two questions into one message.

First understand: whether customers and suppliers are both included and how many parties; the
contractual payment terms and the actual cycle measured separately for customers and for
suppliers; the measurement basis (invoice or bill date to settlement date, to first settlement
date, due date to settlement date, or a weighted settlement date); whether due dates are recorded
and whether aging is possible at invoice or bill level; which aging buckets are already in use;
whether part-payments occur; the current process and how it is reconciled; and whether I need
cycle measurement, aging, the debtor-versus-creditor comparison, working-capital analysis, or all
of them.

Then recommend the smallest setup that fits, explain briefly why the layers are needed, and wait
for me to ask before you build anything.

Use three logical datasets, and do not force them into one table:
  party-period credit-cycle summary
  invoice/bill aging detail
  per-period debtor-versus-creditor working-capital comparison

Keep these six concepts separate, and never substitute one for another:
  contractual terms
  actual cycle
  benchmark
  aging
  debtor-creditor cycle gap
  working-capital funding

The party-period summary uses: Analysis Number, Period Start, Period End, Party Type, Party Name,
Opening Balance, Credit Movement, Settlement, Adjustments, Closing Balance, Average Balance,
Measurement Basis, Contractual Terms Days, Actual Collection/Payment Days, Weighted Days, Overdue
Amount, Current Amount, Aging 0-30 Amount, Aging 31-60 Amount, Aging 61-90 Amount, Aging 91-180 Amount, Aging Over 180 Amount,
Customer Credit Limit, Customer Credit Utilisation %, Benchmark Days, Gap vs Benchmark, Cycle
Trend, Reconciliation Status, Data Quality Status, Reviewed By, Status, Notes, Cycle Analysis ID.
Customer Credit Limit and Customer Credit Utilisation % are customer-only and are never applied
to a supplier.

The invoice/bill aging detail uses: Aging Detail ID, Party Type, Party Name, Invoice/Bill Number,
Invoice/Bill Date, Due Date, Original Amount, Settled Amount, Outstanding Amount, Settlement Date,
Days Overdue, Aging Bucket, Period End, Notes. A party can hold several aging buckets at the same
time, so a single Aging Bucket never sits on a party-period row.

The working-capital comparison uses: Comparison ID, Period Start, Period End, Debtor Collection
Days, Creditor Payment Days, Cycle Gap Days, Relevant Daily Credit Movement, Estimated
Working-Capital Funding, Calculation Basis, Data Quality Status, Cycle Trend, Reviewed By, Status,
Notes.

Use these calculations:
  Closing Balance = Opening Balance + Credit Movement - Settlement +/- Adjustments
  Cycle Gap Days = Debtor Collection Days - Creditor Payment Days
  Gap vs Benchmark = Actual Collection/Payment Days - Benchmark Days
  Days Overdue = Period End - Due Date
  Customer Credit Utilisation % = Outstanding Customer Balance / Customer Credit Limit x 100
  Estimated Working-Capital Funding = Cycle Gap Days x Relevant Daily Credit Movement
  Weighted Settlement Date = SUM (Settled Amount x Settlement Date) / SUM (Settled Amount)

Calculate actual collection and payment days from documented invoice/bill and settlement dates.
Support partial payments with the weighted settlement calculation and record that it was used. Do
not use contractual terms as actual cycle days. Interpret the cycle gap descriptively - a
positive gap is not automatically bad. Do not guess a due date from payment terms. Compute
working-capital funding only when a monetary basis exists, and always record Calculation Basis
alongside it.

A benchmark must be supplied by me, explicitly selected by me, or clearly labelled a proposed
default - never presented as a business target.

Before a record is complete, validate the balance reconciliation and the data quality, and record
Reconciliation Status and Data Quality Status. Never silently correct an inconsistent balance.
Never invent a missing value, benchmark, currency, date, payment behaviour, credit limit or
financial impact. Unknown is a correct answer and is never turned into zero.

When I explicitly ask for artifacts, build one canonical field dictionary first and derive every
requested artifact from it. If I ask for all four, produce CSV, SQL DDL, JSON Schema and the
Notion property mapping, with identical field names, types, order and required status across all
four. Use obviously fake example data only.

If I ask for a review, review the existing design instead of rebuilding it. If I ask for a fix,
preserve the valid information I supplied and correct only the structural, calculation,
data-quality and consistency problems.
```
