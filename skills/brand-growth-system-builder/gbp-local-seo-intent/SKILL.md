# GBP & Local SEO Intent

**What it is:** the Google Business Profile taken from claimed to complete, with the search-intent map behind it - which query means what, which one the profile should answer, and what proves the answer is right.

## Overview

Works out the smallest useful profile for the business in front of it, then builds it only
when asked. The default output is a short recommendation, not a profile. The GBP register -
CSV, SQL DDL, JSON Schema, Notion mapping - is produced on request, from one field list so
the four cannot drift apart.

Layer: Layer 3: Acquire. Fits: Starter stage. Table code: n/a.

**The rule this table exists to enforce:** five different things are recorded in one place
and must not be confused - the profile itself, the services, the posts, the reviews, and
the questions. A `Row Type` discriminator keeps them apart, because a profile update and a
review reply are different actions with different owners, and merging them turns the
register into a log nothing can be filtered out of.

**The second rule:** local rank is relevance, distance and prominence. A profile controls
relevance directly and prominence partly. Nobody can buy a better local rank, and this skill
never suggests otherwise.

## When to Use This Skill

- Google Business Profile, Google My Business, GMB, GBP
- map pack, local pack, local SEO, "near me" searches
- "we do not appear on Google Maps"
- categories, services, products, attributes, business description
- GBP posts, updates, offers, events
- reviews, review replies, review strategy
- Bing Places, Apple Business Connect, and the other map surfaces
- local keyword and intent research

Do not use it for: the website's own page structure (`business-website-setup`), off-site
directory citations (`seo-directory-backlinks`), or paid advertising - which buys clicks,
not rank.

## How It Works

Follow the [shared execution contract](../../../references/execution-contract.md). The module-specific rules below define only domain fields, decisions, calculations, and safety constraints.

### Step 1 - Identify intent

Read the request and pick the intent before asking anything.

- "set up" / "claim" / "we do not have one" -> artifacts wanted; go to Step 2.
- "we have one, it is not showing" -> something exists; capture the current state, then
  Step 2.
- "review" / "audit" / "what is wrong with it" -> a check, not a build.
- "which keywords" / "why do we not rank" -> an intent question, not a build.

One message, one question, no batching. Open with:

> **Q:** What is the business called, and what does one line of it actually do?

### Step 2 - Ask only what is missing

Treat ambiguous replies as unanswered and ask which explicit option the user means. Record unknown values as `Unknown`; `Unknown` is not zero. A record must not be `Done` when a required check fails.

Skip anything already answered. Ask the rest one at a time, and stop as soon as the
remaining answers would not change the profile spec.

- **Location** - Can customers visit a physical address, or is it a service-area business?
  / One location or several? / City, country, and the exact address as it should print?
- **What it does** - The full service list, in the words customers would use? / What does
  a new customer ask for first? / Is there a second, different kind of work?
- **Current state** - Is a profile already claimed and verified? / Who owns the login, and
  is it a personal account or a shared one? / What is the review count and average now?
- **Proof** - Can the premises be photographed, inside and out? / Is there a team, a
  process, stock or equipment worth showing? / Any seasonal or by-appointment behaviour?
- **Engagement** - Who reviews replies, and how fast? / Is anyone being asked for a
  review, and by what method? / Is there time to post weekly?

Never invent an answer. Address, phone, categories, services, review counts, ratings,
keywords, opening hours and metrics the user has not supplied are `Unknown`. A review count
is a measurement, never an estimate.

### Step 3 - Hold the internal context

```yaml
module: gbp-local-seo-intent
intent: null            # set up | fix | review | report | import
scale: null             # Starter | Growth | Scale, only if the answer changes it
areas:
  "Location": null
  "What It Does": null
  "Current State": null
  "Proof": null
  "Engagement": null
requested_outputs: []
confirmed_facts: []
open_questions: []
```

### Step 4 - Recommend the smallest workflow

Give a short recommendation, then ask whether to build it. Do not build unprompted.

**Recommended approach:** One verified profile with the most specific accurate primary
category, up to secondary categories that are genuinely true, a service list in the words
customers use, the business description written plainly with the service area named, and
opening hours including special hours. Then the two things that actually move it: a weekly
post, and one new review a week, replied to. Photographs of the real premises, added
monthly. Every field mirrored onto Bing Places and Apple Business Connect, and the intent
map written down so the same terms are used on the website.

**Why this one:** The profile is the strongest asset a local business owns, and completeness
beats cleverness. A completely filled profile with a weekly post and steady reviews
outperforms a clever one that is left alone for a year. And the intent map is what stops the
website, the profile and the directories using three different words for the same service.

**Workflow:** Address type confirmed → Primary category chosen as the most specific true
one → Secondary categories added → Services listed in customer words → Description written
and services named → Photos added of the real premises → Bing and Apple mirrored → Weekly
post scheduled → Review request process running → Replies written within the week →
Intent map shared with the website and the directories

### Step 5 - Build only on request

Once the user asks for it, derive the fields from the confirmed context and emit the
artifacts as data only. No preamble, no summary, no closing line.

**Notion needs a connected workspace first.** When the user selects Notion as the
output, emit the connection prerequisite from the
[shared execution contract](../../../references/execution-contract.md) verbatim before
the Notion mapping, then stop and wait for the reply "Notion connected." If the user
would rather not connect, emit the mapping as text, add one line saying it is
unverified until the workspace is connected, and offer
[notion-manual-import](../../notion-manual-import/SKILL.md) for the full manual path.
Never claim a connection exists, and never ask for a Notion password or token.

## Select Options

**Row Type** - the discriminator. Nine kinds of thing live in this table and they are
filtered on this column constantly. A review is not a post, and a service is not a profile
field.

```
Profile | Service | Category | Attribute | Post | Review | Question | Photo | Product
```

**Search Intent** - the same four intents as the website, plus local. A local pack
appearance is a `Local intent` result; everything else on the profile supports it.

```
Informational | Commercial investigation | Transactional | Navigational | Local intent
```

**Media Attached** - posts with an image outperform text-only posts consistently.

```
None | Photo | Photo set | Video
```

**Post Type** - `Offer` is the only one that can expire, and an offer without an expiry
stays on the profile for ever.

```
None | Update | Offer | Event | Product
```

**Call To Action** - Google supplies a fixed list. Use one of these, not a custom phrase, so
the button renders.

```
None | Learn more | Call now | Book | Get offer | Sign up | Shop | Order
```

**Review Reply Status** - the field that turns a review into a task. `Reply overdue` is
what makes the cadence visible.

```
Not applicable | Replied | Reply pending | Reply overdue
```

**Category Role** - primary is the single most important setting on the whole profile.

```
Primary | Secondary | Not applicable
```

**Action Type** - what the row exists to make happen.

```
None | Set up | Edit | Reply | Request | Verify | Mirror | Suspend | Escalate
```

**Data Quality Status**

```
Complete | Incomplete | Needs Review | Blocked
```

**Status**

```
Planned | In progress | Live | Needs update | Retired
```

## Relations

None standalone. Worth confirming with the business:

- `Landing Page URL` points at a page in `business-website-setup`. Confirm whether the
  business wants the two joined before it is made live; the URL text is the reliable key
  until they are.
- `Owner` points at the people register in the operational pack, which is not in this
  artifact set. It stays Text with a note naming the intended target.

## Examples

**Prompt**

```
We are not showing up on Google Maps at all. Our competitors in the same street show up
for everything. I made a profile a year ago and gave up when verification asked for a
video of the shopfront.
```

**Context first** - one question per message, nothing already answered:

> **Q:** What is the business called, and what does one line of it actually do?
> **A:** Example Retail, home and kitchen goods.
>
> **Q:** Do customers visit the shop, and what is the exact address as it should print?
> **A:** Yes, one shop. It is in the shopfront.
>
> **Q:** What is the full service list, in the words customers use?
> **A:** Cookware, storage, small appliances, and same-day delivery.
>
> **Q:** Did the verification video ever go in, or is the profile still unverified?
> **A:** Still unverified. That is why we gave up.
>
> **Q:** Is anyone asking customers for reviews at the moment?
> **A:** We put a card on the counter. Nothing has come of it.

**Recommended next step** - offered, not built:

> Finish the verification first - an unverified profile ranks for nothing, so everything
> else is wasted until it is done. Then the most specific true primary category, the
> services in the words customers use, a plain description that names the delivery area,
> and the same data mirrored to Bing Places and Apple Business Connect. Then the two things
> that actually move it: a weekly post, and one new review a week, replied to. The counter
> card needs a URL with a prefilled review shortlink, not a QR code to your homepage.
>
> Workflow: Address type confirmed → Verification completed → Primary category chosen →
> Services listed in customer words → Description written → Photos of the real premises
> added → Bing and Apple mirrored → Weekly post scheduled → Review request process running
> → Replies written within the week → Intent map shared with the website
>
> Want the CSV, SQL DDL, JSON Schema and Notion mapping for this?

## Best Practices

- Recommend before building. The recommendation is the product; the files are the follow-up.
- One question per message. A batched intake reads as a form and gets guessed at.
- Complete the profile before optimising it. An unverified profile is invisible, so nothing
  else matters until verification finishes.
- Pick the most specific true primary category. A generic category is a fight against
  businesses with a more specific one, and a category that is not accurate is a suspension
  risk.
- Only add secondary categories that are genuinely true. A category is a statement about
  the business, not a keyword slot.
- Write the description in plain words, name the services and the service area inside it,
  and do not put a URL or a promotional phrase in it. Google strips both.
- Never add a keyword to the business name. It is a policy violation and the fastest route
  to suspension. If a keyword is needed in the name, the route is a permitted registered or
  trading name, obtained properly - not a string typed into a free field.
- For a service-area business with no walk-in premises, hide the address and set the
  service area. Do not use a virtual address, a co-working space or a friend's home -
  suspension and a manual action are the likely outcomes.
- One post a week with a real photo and one call to action. A post with no image is a
  text-only post, and it underperforms.
- Give every offer post an expiry date. An offer left up for ever looks abandoned.
- One new review a week, forever. Google weighs review count, recency and rating together,
  so steady new reviews beat a burst of thirty in one week.
- Reply to every review, including the good ones. A substantial share of customers read the
  responses before deciding, which makes the reply a conversion factor rather than damage
  control. Reply to a bad review by acknowledging the specific complaint, saying what will
  change, and moving it off-platform - never by arguing, and never by revealing anything
  about the reviewer.
- Ask for reviews at the moment of satisfaction, with a short link generated from the
  profile, not a QR code to the homepage.
- Photograph the real premises, the real team and the real work. Stock is the clearest
  possible signal that nobody has been there.
- Keep the hours correct, including special hours for holidays. Wrong hours generate both
  one-star reviews and lost customers.
- Use the same words on the website, the profile and the directories. Write the intent map
  down once and share it; the profile, the page and the citation all read from it.
- Never buy reviews, and never buy a better rank. Neither is possible, both are policy
  violations, and both are detected.
- Derive all four artifacts from the field list in this file, never by hand.
- If the user requests an example row, keep it obviously fake so nobody imports it as a real profile.

## Limitations

- This is a plan and a register. It does not create, claim, verify or edit a profile, and it
  calls no Google APIs.
- It cannot see the current profile, its categories, its ranking, its review count or its
  competitors. Every current-state value must come from the business.
- `Review Rating` and `Review Count` are measurements the business supplies. This skill
  never estimates them and never fills a plausible number.
- Google states the three local ranking factors - relevance, distance and prominence -
  and states that no one can pay for a better local rank. Any weight given to a factor by
  a third party is that third party's estimate, not Google's, and this skill does not
  present one as fact.
- Category lists, attributes and service options change without notice. A category that
  exists today may not next quarter.
- Search volumes, keyword difficulty and competitor positions are not measured here. Those
  need a keyword tool the business has access to.
- Post reach, click-through and conversion data live in the profile's own analytics, and
  the thresholds are Google's own.
- Suspension and reinstatement are decisions Google makes. This skill can identify the
  policy risk in a plan; it cannot decide an outcome.
- Multi-location businesses need a location group, unique profiles, unique descriptions and
  a naming convention. That is a larger build than this table and needs confirming first.
- "Competitors show up for everything" usually means a more complete profile, more reviews
  and closer proximity - not that they did something the business cannot do.

## Security & Safety Notes

- Never invent an address, a phone number, a category, a service, a review count, a rating,
  a keyword or a metric. `Unknown`, blank and `0.0` where nothing has been measured are
  correct.
- Never paste a real customer list, a review export containing customer names, or a
  verified-address document into this table. A review with a name and photo is personal
  data, and the address of the premises is sensitive in some jurisdictions.
- The profile login must not be a personal account that one person controls and nobody
  else can reach. A shared account with named managers and named access is the
  recommendation; losing the owner account is how businesses lose their profile.
- Two-factor authentication on the profile account, and a record of who has manager access.
- Never fabricate or incentivise a review. A review gate - asking only happy customers -
  breaches Google's policy and is detectable.
- Never advise a virtual address, a coworking membership or a friend's premises to appear
  in the map pack. It is a guideline violation and the suspension is usually permanent for
  that profile.
- Reply content to a negative review is a public statement. It must never include a
  customer's personal details, a transaction reference or a service detail that identifies
  them. Move it to a private channel.
- Verification documents - a video of the shopfront, a utility bill, a lease - are
  sensitive. They should go to Google directly and never into this table or a chat.
- Creating a requested artifact may write that artifact locally. Do not run commands,
  call APIs, provision infrastructure, or make other external changes unless the user
  explicitly requests and authorizes them.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Problem:** the Notion mapping is handed over with no workspace connected.
  **Solution:** the connection prerequisite goes first, and a mapping handed over as
  text is labelled unverified until the workspace is connected.
- **Problem:** asked all five questions in one message.
  **Solution:** ask one, wait, and drop any the first answer already covered.
- **Problem:** the profile is unverified and everything else is being optimised.
  **Solution:** finish verification first. Nothing ranks on an unverified profile, so the
  rest is wasted effort.
- **Problem:** the business name is now "Example Retail - Best Cookware Shop in Example
  City".
  **Solution:** that is a policy violation. Revert to the real name and put the keyword in
  the description and the services.
- **Problem:** a virtual office address was used for a service-area business.
  **Solution:** hide the address, set the service area properly, and expect either a
  suspension or a wasted profile.
- **Problem:** one post was published eighteen months ago.
  **Solution:** dormant profiles lose visibility. A weekly post with a real photo is the
  cheapest ongoing work on this list.
- **Problem:** fifty reviews arrived in one week from the same device.
  **Solution:** that pattern is a policy violation risk, and the volume is worth less than
  the appearance. Steady, one a week, is what the signal actually rewards.
- **Problem:** the profile, the website and three directories all describe the service
  differently.
  **Solution:** write the intent map once and use it everywhere. Inconsistency dilutes all
  of them.
- **Problem:** a category was added because a competitor had it.
  **Solution:** categories are a statement of fact. An inaccurate category is a suspension
  risk and gains nothing.
- **Problem:** the review replies all say "Thank you for your feedback."
  **Solution:** a reply that could apply to any business is not a reply. Say something
  specific to what the customer actually said.
- **Problem:** all four artifacts drift apart.
  **Solution:** derive all four from the field list in this file, never by hand.

## Reusable Prompt

```
I want my Google Business Profile set up properly and ranked - categories, services,
description, posts, photos and a review process, plus the search-intent map behind it.
Ask me one short question at a time, and only about what I have not already told you.
Never invent an address, a category, a review count, a rating or a keyword. Confirm
verification first, and never suggest anything that violates Google's business name or
address policy. Wait for me to ask before you build anything.
When I ask, output CSV, SQL DDL, JSON Schema and a Notion property mapping. Data only.
```
