# Mentorship Program

**What it is:** Internal mentoring.

## Overview

Works out the smallest useful **Mentorship Program** setup for the business in front of it, then
builds it only when asked. The default output is a short recommendation, not a
spreadsheet. Artifacts - CSV, SQL DDL, JSON Schema, Notion mapping - are produced on
request, from one field list so they cannot drift apart.

Layer: Layer 5: Develop. Fits: Scale stage. Table code: n/a.

## When to Use This Skill

- mentorship program
- mentor matching
- internal mentoring tracker
- mentor mentee pairs

Also use it when the user says "internal mentoring", or describes the same process happening in a
spreadsheet, a document or someone inboxes.

Do not use it for: payroll calculation, tax filing, or legal advice. This skill produces
empty templates only - it never holds or processes real employee or customer data.

## How It Works

### Step 1 - Identify intent

Read the request and pick the intent before asking anything.

- "set up" or "build" or "create" -> the user wants artifacts; go to Step 2.
- "our process is ..." or "it is in a sheet" -> the user wants to move an existing process; capture it, then Step 2.
- "is this right" or "review" or "audit" -> the user wants a check, not a build; answer from what they share.
- "how do I ..." -> advice question; answer directly and offer the build only if it helps.

One message, one question, no batching. Open with:

> **Q:** How many people want to be mentored?

### Step 2 - Ask only what is missing

Skip anything the user already answered, in any earlier message. Ask the rest one at a
time, and stop as soon as the remaining answers would not change the output.

- **People** - Mentees and mentors? / How many pairs? / Same team or cross-team?
- **Programme** - How long? / Session cadence? / Structured or informal?
- **Matching** - How matched today? / By skill or interest? / Who approves?
- **Current process** - Anything running now? / How tracked? / What failed before?
- **Outcome** - What do you need? / Matching, session tracking or feedback?

Never invent an answer. If the user does not know, record it as unknown and carry on.

### Step 3 - Build the internal context

Hold the answers in this shape. It stays internal - it is not shown to the user unless
they ask, and it never carries a value the user did not give.

```yaml
module: mentorship-program
intent: null            # set in Step 1, one of: set up, fix, review, report, import
scale: null             # Starter | Growth | Scale, only if the answer changes it
areas:
  "People": null
  "Programme": null
  "Matching": null
  "Current process": null
  "Outcome": null
requested_outputs: []   # csv | sql | json | notion - only what was explicitly asked for
confirmed_facts: []     # only what the user actually said
open_questions: []      # the unanswered ones, in the order worth asking
```

### Step 4 - Recommend the smallest workflow

Give a short recommendation, then ask whether to build it. Do not build unprompted. Ask: "Want me to build the CSV, SQL DDL, JSON Schema, Notion mapping, or an Excel workbook from these confirmed rules?"

**Recommended approach:** Match on a stated goal rather than availability, and track only sessions and a closing rating.

**Why this one:** Mentorship fails when pairs are assigned by convenience and never meet. A stated goal for the mentee is what makes a pair worth recording.

**Workflow:** Mentee goal → Match → Sessions → Mid review → Close with rating

### Step 5 - Build only on request

Once the user asks for it, derive the fields from the confirmed context and emit the
artifacts as data only. No preamble, no summary, no closing line.

An Excel workbook is the CSV emitted with a UTF-8 byte order mark, so Excel opens it with
correct text and no import dialog. A CSV carries no types, so after it, name the columns
that need a number, date or currency format applied.

```csv
Mentorship Pair,Department,End Date,Focus Area,Last Session,Mentee Goal,Mentee Name,Mentor Name,Mentorship ID,Next Session,Overall Rating,Progress Notes,Sessions Completed,Sessions Planned,Start Date,Status
Priya Nair + Rohit Verma,Delivery,2026-11-27,Stakeholder management and commercial conversations.,2026-01-08,Lead two client calls end to end this quarter.,Priya Nair,Rohit Verma,,2026-01-22,4,Two of four goals on track. Delegation still needs work.,5,12,2026-02-02,Active
```

One example row per artifact, visibly fake. Money stays `currency`, dates stay `date`,
and anything pointing at another table stays `relation`.

| 15 | Start Date | `date` | `DATE` | `string, format: date` | Date | `2026-02-02` |
| 16 | Status | `select` | `VARCHAR(100)` | `string` | Select (add options after import) | `Active` |

## Select Options

**Status**

```
Proposed | Active | Paused | Completed | Ended
```

## Relations

Link fields: `Mentee Name`, `Mentor Name`

## Examples

**Prompt**

```
We want to run mentoring for people joining the delivery team.
```

**Context first** - one question per message, nothing already answered:

> **Q:** How many pairs?
> **A:** Six.
>
> **Q:** How long?
> **A:** Six months.
>
> **Q:** How matched now?
> **A:** Not at all.

**Recommended next step** - offered, not built:

> Match on a stated goal rather than availability, and track only sessions and a closing rating.
>
> Workflow: Mentee goal → Match → Sessions → Mid review → Close with rating
>
> Want the CSV, SQL, JSON Schema and Notion mapping for this?

## Best Practices

- Recommend before building. The recommendation is the product; the files are the follow-up.
- One question per message. A batched intake reads as a form and gets guessed at.
- Keep every field name identical across CSV, SQL and JSON Schema.
- Use `relation` for anything that points at another table, `text` only for free text.
- Money fields are `currency`, never `text`. Dates are `date`, never free text.
- Keep the example row obviously fake so nobody imports it as real data.

## Limitations

- Empty template only. It does not compute payroll, tax, leave balances or KPIs.
- Notion relations need both databases imported before the link column resolves.
- Select options are a starting set. Rename them to match how the business talks.
- No automation, reminders or sync. Those need the integration layer.
- Does not match people automatically or send session reminders.
- Legal, tax and HR review is still required before this drives real decisions.

## Security & Safety Notes

- Never fill in real names, salaries, medical or banking data. Placeholders only.
- Never mark an example row `Confidential`, and keep bank details masked.
- This skill writes nothing outside the chat. It runs no commands and calls no APIs.
- If the user pastes real employee data, generate the template and tell them to delete
  the pasted data from the conversation.
- Privacy, legal and disciplinary cases need a qualified human reviewer before anything
  is acted on.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Problem:** asked all six questions in one message.
  **Solution:** ask one, wait, and drop any the first answer already covered.
- **Problem:** built a full system when one table was asked for.
  **Solution:** build what was requested; mention the parent skill separately.
- **Problem:** all four artifacts drift apart.
  **Solution:** derive all four from the field list in this file, never by hand.
- **Problem:** Notion import shows every column as Text.
  **Solution:** that is expected. Apply the property mapping table once, after import.

- `notification-reminder-hub` - turns due dates in this module into reminders.

## Reusable Prompt

```
I want to set up internal mentoring for my company.
Ask me one short question at a time, and only about what I have not already told you.
Then recommend the smallest setup that fits, and wait for me to ask before you build it.
When I ask, output CSV, SQL DDL, JSON Schema, a Notion property mapping or an Excel workbook. Data only.
```
