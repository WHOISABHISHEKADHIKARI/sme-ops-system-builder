# Day Book

**What it is:** The daily cash, bank and digital receipt-and-payment record, with a day-end control row that reconciles the day before it is closed.

## Overview

Works out the smallest useful **Day Book** setup for the business in front of it, then builds it
only when asked. The default output is a short recommendation, not a spreadsheet. Artifacts - CSV,
SQL DDL, JSON Schema, Notion mapping - are produced on request, from one field list so they
cannot drift apart.

Layer: Layer 4: Cash. Fits: Starter stage. Table code: n/a.

**Before anything is generated, the design is checked against itself.** A day book is the easiest
table in the pack to write badly, because the same column can mean two different things on two
different rows and neither reading looks wrong on its own. So before emitting any artifact:

- Look for conflicts in the rules, the examples, the field definitions, the row meanings and the
  output formats. Where the design, the examples or the business's existing sheet disagree with
  each other, do not reproduce them as they stand.
- Name the conflict out loud, then resolve it with the simplest accounting-safe interpretation.
  The simplest safe reading of a disputed field is the one that keeps cash equal to the bank
  position and never invents a movement to make a total look right.
- Derive CSV, SQL DDL, JSON Schema and the Notion mapping from **one** field model afterwards, so
  that no field exists in one artifact and is missing or differently defined in another.

**The rule this table exists to enforce: the debit/credit presentation of a day book depends on
the software's day-book format.** It is not a universal rule that all receipts are debit and all
payments are credit - some books present receipts on the payment side, some carry both columns,
some carry neither. So this table does not hardcode a Debit/Credit pair. `Debit/Credit
Presentation` is a text field that records the presentation **as configured in the business's own
software**, and the six in/out amount columns plus the six balance columns are the part that is
universal. Where a book labels its columns `Dr` and `Cr`, that label is what goes into
`Debit/Credit Presentation`; nothing in this table decides which side a receipt sits on.

**Two row types, and they are not the same kind of thing.** `Row Type` says which one a row is, and
the two are read differently.

| | `Movement` row | `Day Summary` row |
|---|---|---|
| What it is | one receipt or one payment | one per day, written after the day is closed |
| What it books | money, into exactly one book | no money at all - it totals and proves |
| `Book Section` | the one book it was booked to | `All Books` |
| `Mode` | the instrument used | `Mixed` when the day's instruments differ |
| The six In/Out columns | the amount in its own book, and the other two are not applicable | the day's totals for all three books |
| The six balance columns | brought forward, and the running balance **after** this entry | the day's opening and closing balances |
| `Transaction Reference`, `Voucher Number`, `Party` | the entry itself | the day's detail set, not a single voucher |
| `Duplicate Check` | this entry checked against the day's other entries | the whole day's set checked |
| `Balance Difference`, `Reconciliation Status` | not applicable - a single movement is not reconciled on its own | the day's break, and the status of it |

**What each balance field means.** Every one of the six balance fields is a balance, never a
movement. `Opening Cash Balance`, `Opening Bank Balance` and `Opening Digital Balance` are what
was brought into the day. `Cash Closing Balance`, `Bank Closing Balance` and `Digital Closing
Balance` are what was left at the end of it. The identity that connects them, per book, is:

```
opening balance + money in - money out = closing balance
```

On a `Day Summary` row that identity must hold separately for cash, for bank and for digital. On
a `Movement` row, the opening balance is what was brought forward into that entry and the closing
balance is the running balance **after** it, in that entry's own book only.

**The identity that carries the day forward.** A day's opening balance is not a fresh number. It
is the **previous day's closing balance** for the same book. So the check that closes a day is:

```
previous day's closing balance + today's movement = today's closing balance
```

Where it does not hold, the difference goes in `Balance Difference` - signed, and not spread
across the books - and `Reconciliation Status` is set to `Needs Review` or `Unreconciled`. The
component is never edited to make the row tie. A day book whose balances are adjusted until they
agree records nothing about the business.

**`Balance Difference` and `Reconciliation Status`.** `Balance Difference` is the total
unexplained difference across the three books on that row: negative where the book is above the
counted or agreed figure, positive where it is below. Where a difference is confined to one book,
write which one in `Notes` with both figures, because one column cannot hold three breaks.
`Reconciliation Status` is the **worst** of the three books, never the best. A bank balance that
agrees does not make a cash count that does not agree reconciled.

**A day is not `Done` while the cash count or the bank position is unreconciled.** Neither is it
`Done` while `Duplicate Check` is `Not Checked`, or `Reconciliation Status` is anything other than
`Reconciled`, or while an entry is `Blocked`. `Entry Verified` is the workflow status
(`Not started | In progress | Blocked | Done | Cancelled`) and it moves to `Done` only when the
control row for that day is clean, or when a human has reviewed and accepted a recorded difference.

**Money, dates and rounding.** Amounts are the gross amounts that actually moved, exactly as
recorded in the business's books, tax-inclusive where the entry was tax-inclusive. This module
does not split tax out of a movement. Money is a bare number with no currency symbol in the cell,
and the currency itself is `Unknown` until the user states it. Dates are ISO `YYYY-MM-DD` in real
date fields. Round once, at the end, to two decimal places, so the day's components re-derive the
day's totals.

## When to Use This Skill

- day book
- daily cash and bank book
- cash book and bank book
- daily receipts and payments register
- end-of-day balance check
- petty cash day sheet

Also use it when the user says "the daily cash, bank and digital receipt-and-payment record, with a
day-end control row that reconciles the day before it is closed", or describes the same process
happening in a spreadsheet, a document or someone inboxes.

Do not use it for: making payments, recording receipts in detail, tax filing, or legal advice. This
skill produces empty templates only - it never holds or processes real transaction data.

## How It Works

Follow the [shared execution contract](../../references/execution-contract.md). The module-specific rules below define only domain fields, decisions, calculations, and safety constraints.

### Step 1 - Identify intent

Read the request and pick the intent before asking anything.

- "set up" or "build" or "create" -> the user wants artifacts; go to Step 2.
- "our process is ..." or "it is in a sheet" -> `import` or `fix`; capture what is there, then Step 2.
- "is this right" or "review this" or "audit this" -> `review`; answer from what they share and do
  not rebuild anything.
- "show me the movement" or "where did the cash go" -> `report`; answer from what they share.
- "how do I ..." -> advice question; answer directly and offer the build only if it helps.

If the intent is already clear from the request, do not ask the user to repeat it.

On a `review`, check the design against itself before checking the numbers: the rules against the
examples, the field definitions against the row meanings, and the four artifacts against each
other. Report the conflicts and the simplest accounting-safe reading of each, then report the
control gaps - an unreconciled balance with no difference field, a `Done` day with an open cash
count, a hardcoded Debit/Credit rule. Do not rebuild the book because a review was asked for.

On a `fix`, preserve every valid fact already in the book, name each contradiction, correct the
model, and keep the change to the minimum that makes it consistent. Rebuild the artifacts only
when the fix request asks for them.

One message, one question, no batching. Open with the question that decides which columns exist:

> **Q:** Which books do you keep separate in the day book - cash, bank, or a digital wallet?

### Step 2 - Ask only what is missing

Treat ambiguous replies as unanswered and ask which explicit option the user means. Record unknown values as `Unknown`; `Unknown` is not zero. A record must not be `Done` when a required check fails.

Skip anything the user already answered, in any earlier message. Ask the rest one at a time, and
stop as soon as the remaining answers would not change the recommendation or the requested
artifact. Never batch two questions into one message.

- **Books** - Cash, bank and digital all separate? Which software or format is the book kept in?
  Entries made daily or weekly?
- **Entries** - Who writes them? From vouchers, or from the bank feed? Same day or the next?
- **Day-end control** - What is actually checked at day end? Is the cash counted? Is the bank
  position agreed, and to what? Who signs it off?
- **Open items** - Digital wallets that settle late? Known duplicate patterns? How is a difference
  handled when it appears?
- **Outcome** - What do you need? The daily book, the day-end reconciliation record, or both?

**An ambiguous answer is not an answer.** `yes`, `no`, `maybe`, `same`, `okay` and `fine` do not
answer a multiple-choice question. Re-ask as an explicit choice:

> **Q:** Which do you mean: **a count of the cash drawer** or **the balance your bank statement
> shows at close**?

A partial answer keeps only the part that was answered. "We check it monthly, and the cash on
Fridays" records the frequency and leaves the digital-wallet position `Unknown`.

**Never invent a business fact.** Not an amount, a balance, a date, a voucher number, a bank
reference, an account number, a mode, a book section, a reviewer name, a status or a difference.
If a value was not supplied by the user or derived by a documented formula from supplied data, it
is `Unknown` or blank. Never turn Unknown into zero - a blank says the count has not been done,
a zero says the drawer is empty. Record `Unknown`, move on, and never re-ask an unknown the user
has already said they do not have.

Where the count or the statement has not been seen, the day's `Balance Difference` is blank and
`Reconciliation Status` is `Unknown`. It is not zero, because a zero difference is a claim that
the money was counted and agreed.

### Step 3 - Hold the internal context

Hold the answers in this shape. It stays internal - it is not shown to the user unless they ask,
and it never carries a value the user did not give.

```yaml
module: day-book
intent: null            # set in Step 1, one of: set up, fix, review, report, import
scale: null             # Starter | Growth | Scale, only if the answer changes it
areas:
  "Books": null
  "Entries": null
  "Day-end control": null
  "Open items": null
  "Outcome": null
books: null             # which of cash | bank | digital are kept separately
book_format: null       # the day-book format of the software in use
debit_credit_presentation: null
cash_counted_daily: null
bank_agreed_to: null     # statement, feed, or neither
sign_off: null
late_settling_wallets: null
known_duplicate_pattern: null
difference_handling: null
requested_outputs: []   # csv | sql | json | notion - only what was explicitly asked for
confirmed_facts: []     # only what the user actually said
unknowns: []            # asked and not answered
open_questions: []      # the unanswered ones, in the order worth asking
```

### Step 4 - Recommend the smallest workflow

Give a short recommendation, then ask whether to build it. Do not build unprompted.

**Recommended approach:** One day book carrying both row types in one field model. One `Movement`
row per receipt and per payment, with a `Book Section` naming cash, bank or digital; one
`Day Summary` row per day carrying that day's opening and closing balance and totals for all three
books; a `Balance Difference` and a `Reconciliation Status` on the day row; and a `Duplicate Check`
before the day is closed.

**Why this one:** The day book is where a missing or duplicated entry becomes visible, and
everything else in the cash cycle is downstream of the balance agreeing at day end. Keeping the
movement rows and the day-end control row in one model - separated by `Row Type` rather than by
guesswork - is what lets the day be proved from itself. Splitting them into two tables loses the
link, and merging them without a discriminator makes a summary row look like one more movement.

**Workflow:** Receipt or payment recorded from voucher → Booked to cash, bank or digital as a
`Movement` row → Running balance updated → Duplicate and missing entries checked → `Day Summary`
row proves previous closing plus movement equals closing, per book → Difference recorded and marked
→ Day-end balance verified and reviewed → Day closed

### Step 5 - Build only on request

Once the user asks for it, derive the fields from one canonical field list and emit the artifacts
as data only. No preamble, no summary, no closing line. A field present in one artifact is present
in all four, in the same order, with the same meaning. Build only what was asked for.

**A selected Notion output is rendered by `notion-manual-import`, so route the
Notion step there.** When the user selects Notion, hand that step to
[notion-manual-import](../notion-manual-import/SKILL.md): it holds the CSV, the property
mapping, the import steps and the verification checklist, and it renders the Field
Reference below instead of defining a table of its own. Do not restate the mapping
here and do not improvise the import steps. If the platform exposes a Notion
connector, emit the connection prerequisite from the
[shared execution contract](../../references/execution-contract.md) verbatim first, then stop and
wait for the reply "Notion connected." and let the helper build in the workspace.
Never claim a connection exists, and never ask for a Notion password or token.

`required` is a business-necessity list, not an availability list. `Entry Date`, `Row Type` and
`Book Section` are required because without them the row cannot be read at all - a row with no
`Row Type` cannot be told apart from a summary, and a row with no `Book Section` touches all three
books by accident. The six balance columns are required because a balance that is not recorded is
not a balance; the six In/Out columns are deliberately **not** required, because on a
`Movement` row the two books it did not touch are not applicable rather than zero, and a required
column invites exactly that substitution. `Duplicate Check`, `Reconciliation Status` and
`Entry Verified` are required so that no day can be closed without the control having been given
an answer. `Balance Difference` is optional, because an uncounted day legitimately has none.

The rows above are documentation examples only. Emit empty templates unless the user explicitly requests examples. Money stays `currency`, dates stay `date`, and
anything pointing at another table stays `relation`. Every option list below is a starting set -
add options after import, and use the values the business already uses.

**The internal-consistency check, run before the artifacts go out.** On the design as proposed,
and again on the four artifacts as written:

- Does every rule have a matching example, and does every example obey every rule?
- Does every field mean the same thing in the CSV, the SQL, the JSON Schema and the Notion
  mapping - same type, same meaning, same position in the list?
- Is any field present in one artifact and missing, renamed or retyped in another?
- Does any single field carry two meanings, and is `Row Type` what separates them?
- Does a stated check have a field that records its result? A check with no field is a claim.
- Does the debit/credit statement match the `Debit/Credit Presentation` field, or has a universal
  rule crept into the model?

If any answer is no, fix the model first and then re-derive the artifacts. Do not ship a set of
four artifacts that disagree with each other.

| 31 | Day Book ID | `id` | `SERIAL PRIMARY KEY` | `integer` | Text (or Notion auto-ID) | `(blank)` |

`Balance Difference` and `Reconciliation Status` are in this list because the day-end control is
the whole point of the table, and a control with no field to record its result is a claim rather
than a check. They replace an earlier bare `Balance Verified` yes/no, which could say *that*
something was out but not *how much*, and which a day with a cash break and an agreed bank
position could have marked `Yes`. `Reconciliation Status` carries the value set
`Reconciled | Needs Review | Unreconciled | Unknown`, and it takes the worst of the three books.

## Select Options

Every list below is a starting set, not the business's confirmed taxonomy. The user's own values
win. In Notion, add the options after import.

**Row Type**

```
Movement | Day Summary
```
**Book Section**

```
Cash Book | Bank Book | Digital Payments Book | All Books
```
**Mode**

```
Cash | Bank | Cheque | Fonepay/QR | Other Digital Payment | Mixed
```
**Duplicate Check**

```
Checked - Clear | Checked - Duplicate Found | Not Checked
```
**Reconciliation Status**

```
Reconciled | Needs Review | Unreconciled | Unknown
```
**Entry Verified**

```
Not started | In progress | Blocked | Done | Cancelled
```

## Relations

Link fields: `Source Documents`

`Source Documents` points at the filing register, so a day-book line can be traced back to the
voucher, receipt or bank advice behind it. In SQL it is `VARCHAR(255)` with a comment rather than
a foreign key, and in Notion it resolves only once the filing register has been imported. The
`VARCHAR(255)` with a comment is deliberate: no `FOREIGN KEY` is declared to a table this build
does not create.

`Transaction Reference` is deliberately free text, not a relation. On a `Movement` row it holds the
receipt, payment or petty-cash number the line came from, and the same number also appears in the
filing register; on a `Day Summary` row it holds the day's own reference. Confirm with the
business whether they want it as a live relation before adding one.

## Examples

**Prompt**

```
We cannot tell at the end of the day whether the bank balance is right, and twice we found the
same payment entered twice.
```

**Context first** - one question per message, nothing already answered:

> **Q:** Which books do you keep separate in the day book?
> **A:** Bank and one Fonepay number. Cash is in the drawer.
>
> **Q:** Who writes the entries?
> **A:** My accounts person, from the vouchers, in the evening.
>
> **Q:** What do you check before the day is closed?
> **A:** Against the bank statement once a month. The cash just goes in the drawer.

**Recommended next step** - offered, not built:

> One day book carrying both row types: a `Movement` row per receipt and per payment with a
> `Book Section` naming cash, bank or digital, and a `Day Summary` row per day carrying that day's
> opening and closing balances and totals for all three books, plus a `Balance Difference` and a
> `Reconciliation Status` on the day row.
>
> Workflow: Receipt or payment recorded from voucher → Booked to cash, bank or digital as a
> `Movement` row → Running balance updated → Duplicate and missing entries checked → `Day Summary`
> row proves previous closing plus movement equals closing, per book → Difference recorded and
> marked → Day-end balance verified and reviewed → Day closed
>
> Want the CSV, SQL, JSON Schema and Notion mapping for this?

## Best Practices

- Recommend before building. The recommendation is the product; the files are the follow-up.
- One question per message. A batched intake reads as a form and gets guessed at.
- Check the design against itself before generating anything, and resolve each conflict with the
  simplest accounting-safe reading rather than reproducing both versions.
- Never hardcode a Debit/Credit rule, and never write that all receipts are debit. The
  presentation follows the software's day-book format, and `Debit/Credit Presentation` records
  what that format actually is.
- Never let one field carry two meanings. `Row Type` says whether a row is a movement or a day-end
  control, and `Book Section` only ever names the book.
- Close the day, not the week. Count the cash, agree the bank balance to the statement and confirm
  the digital wallet balance before the day is marked verified.
- A day's opening balance is the previous day's closing balance. Where they disagree, that is the
  difference - not a fresh number typed in to make the day look complete.
- Record the difference, never repair it. `Balance Difference` is signed, and the component that
  caused it is left alone for a human to resolve.
- Take `Reconciliation Status` as the worst of the three books. A bank that agrees does not
  reconcile a cash drawer that does not.
- Use `Duplicate Check` honestly. `Not Checked` is a valid answer; a false `Checked - Clear` is
  not, and it is not compatible with `Done`.
- One `Movement` row per entry, from the voucher. A day book written from memory is where
  duplicates and omissions come from.
- Leave a book that a movement did not touch blank rather than zero. Blank means not applicable
  here; zero would claim the drawer was counted and empty.
- Keep the narration specific enough to be understood six months later - invoice number, party and
  what it was for.
- Keep every field name, type and position identical across CSV, SQL, JSON Schema and the Notion
  mapping. A field that is in one and missing or retyped in another is the defect, not a detail.
- Money fields are `currency`, never `text`. Dates are `date`, never free text. Round once, at the
  end, so the day re-derives from its movements.
- If the user requests an example row, keep it obviously fake so nobody imports it as real data.

## Limitations

- Empty template only. It does not post entries, move money or connect to a bank feed.
- The debit/credit presentation cannot be settled by this skill. It follows whatever the
  business's software produces, so read the format out of the software and write it into
  `Debit/Credit Presentation` rather than assuming one.
- The six balance columns are entered, not computed. The identity on a `Day Summary` row is what
  tests them, and `Balance Difference` is what records the test failing - so a book that is never
  tested is a book that never finds its own errors.
- `Balance Difference` holds the total across the three books. A break in more than one book
  cannot be attributed from that column alone, so per-book figures go in `Notes`.
- A day book is a record of what was entered, not proof that it was correct. The proof comes from
  the supporting document, which is why the source link and the voucher number are on every row.
- Digital wallet balances settle late against some aggregators, so a same-day agreement is not
  always possible. `Reconciliation Status` = `Unknown` exists for that, and it is an honest answer.
- Reconciliation against the bank statement is a separate routine; this table records that it was
  done, not what it found.
- It records a duplicate; it does not delete one, and it does not decide which of two identical
  entries is the mistaken one.
- Notion relations need both databases imported before the link column resolves.
- Select options are a starting set. Rename them to match how the business talks.
- No automation, reminders or sync. Those need the integration layer.
- Legal, tax and HR review is still required before this drives real decisions.

## Security & Safety Notes

- Never fill in real names, bank details or transaction references. Placeholders only.
- Never mark an example row `Confidential`, and keep bank details masked.
- A day book is a map of every movement of the business's money. Do not paste real statements,
  balances or UTR references into a chat.
- A duplicate or a balance break is a control finding, not a clerical fix. Report it, do not edit
  the balance to make it go away.
- Creating a requested artifact may write that artifact locally. Do not run commands,
  call APIs, provision infrastructure, or make other external changes unless the user
  explicitly requests and authorizes them.
- If the user pastes real transaction data, generate the template and tell them to delete the
  pasted data from the conversation.
- Privacy, legal and disciplinary cases need a qualified human reviewer before anything is acted
  on.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Problem:** the Notion mapping is handed over with no workspace connected.
  **Solution:** the connection prerequisite goes first, and a mapping handed over as
  text is labelled unverified until the workspace is connected.
- **Problem:** asked all six questions in one message.
  **Solution:** ask one, wait, and drop any the first answer already covered.
- **Problem:** the day book was built with hardcoded Debit and Credit columns, or receipts were
  assumed to be on the debit side.
  **Solution:** the presentation depends on the software's format. Capture it in
  `Debit/Credit Presentation` instead of assuming a universal rule.
- **Problem:** a summary row got read as one more movement, and the day's totals were added to the
  day's movements.
  **Solution:** `Row Type` is what tells them apart. A `Day Summary` row books no money; it totals
  the `Movement` rows above it and tests the identity per book.
- **Problem:** a balance field was read as today's money moved.
  **Solution:** the balance fields are balances. The `Opening * Balance` fields are brought
  forward, the `* Closing Balance` fields are what is left after the entry or the day.
- **Problem:** the Overview claimed the day row proved the balance while the model had no field
  that could record whether it did.
  **Solution:** a check with no field is a claim. `Balance Difference` and `Reconciliation Status`
  are the fields that make the day-end control real.
- **Problem:** an earlier bare `Balance Verified` yes/no was marked `Yes` on a day when the cash
  was short and only the bank had been agreed.
  **Solution:** `Reconciliation Status` takes the worst of the three books, and `Balance
  Difference` says by how much.
- **Problem:** the day was marked `Done` with the cash drawer uncounted and the bank position
  unagreed.
  **Solution:** a day must not be `Done` while the cash count or the bank position is
  unreconciled, or while `Duplicate Check` is `Not Checked`. The day is `In progress` until a
  human accepts a recorded difference.
- **Problem:** a balance break was absorbed by editing the closing balance so the row tied.
  **Solution:** record the signed difference, set the status, and leave the component alone.
- **Problem:** a book a movement did not touch was filled with `0.00`.
  **Solution:** leave it blank. Blank means not applicable on this row; zero claims a count was
  taken and the drawer was empty.
- **Problem:** the same cheque or UTR is entered twice and both stay.
  **Solution:** run the duplicate check on the transaction reference, set `Checked - Duplicate
  Found`, and resolve it with a human.
- **Problem:** the balance is verified only at month end.
  **Solution:** day end is the control. `Reconciliation Status` = `Unknown` is what an uncounted
  day looks like.
- **Problem:** a day-book line is written with no source document.
  **Solution:** the line is a claim. Link the source or mark the entry blocked.
- **Problem:** a field existed in the CSV but not in the SQL, or was defined differently in the
  JSON Schema or the Notion mapping.
  **Solution:** derive all four from one field list, and run the internal-consistency check before
  the artifacts go out.
- **Problem:** built a full system when the daily book alone was asked for.
  **Solution:** build what was requested; mention the parent skill separately.
- **Problem:** all four artifacts drift apart.
  **Solution:** derive all four from the field list in this file, never by hand.
- **Problem:** Notion import shows every column as Text.
  **Solution:** that is expected. Apply the property mapping table once, after import, and add the
  Select options then.

## Reusable Prompt

```
I want to set up a day book for my company - daily cash, bank and digital receipts and payments,
one movement row per entry, one day-summary row per day, an opening and a closing balance for each
book, a duplicate check and a day-end balance verification.

Ask me one short question per message, and only about what I have not already told you. Never
batch two questions into one message.

Before you generate anything, check the proposed design against itself. If the rules, the
examples, the field definitions, the row meanings or the output formats disagree with each other,
do not reproduce them as they stand: tell me the conflict and resolve it with the simplest
accounting-safe interpretation, then derive all four artifacts from one consistent field model so
that no field exists in one artifact and is missing or differently defined in another.

Keep the two row types apart with a Row Type field. On a Movement row the amount, the reference,
the voucher number and the party are the entry, the Book Section names the one book it touched,
and only that book's In/Out amounts and balances are affected. On a Day Summary row the per-book
In/Out figures are the day's totals, the balances are the day's opening and closing, the reference
fields describe the day's detail set rather than one voucher, and Book Section is All Books.

Define every balance field exactly: the Opening * Balance fields are what was brought into the
day, the * Closing Balance fields are what was left at the end of it, and neither is ever today's
movement. A day's opening balance is the previous day's closing balance for the same book, and the
check that closes a day is previous closing plus today's movement equals today's closing, proved
separately for cash, for bank and for digital.

Keep the Debit/Credit presentation software-dependent. Never hardcode a Dr/Cr pair and never
assume that all receipts are debit - record what the business's own software does in Debit/Credit
Presentation.

Record the day's break as a signed Balance Difference with a Reconciliation Status of Reconciled,
Needs Review, Unreconciled or Unknown, taking the worst of the three books, and write per-book
figures in Notes. A day must not be Done while the cash count or the bank position is
unreconciled, or while the duplicate check has not been run.

An ambiguous answer is not an answer: if I say yes, maybe, same, okay or fine to a choice, ask me
again as an explicit choice. Never invent an amount, a balance, a date, a voucher number, a bank
reference, a mode or a status. Unknown is a correct answer and is never turned into zero, so a book
a movement did not touch is left blank rather than filled with 0.00.

Then recommend the smallest setup that fits, and wait for me to ask before you build it. When I ask,
output CSV, SQL DDL, JSON Schema and a Notion property mapping, with identical field names, types,
order and meaning across all four. Use obviously fake example data only.

If I ask for a review, review the design instead of rebuilding it. If I ask for a fix, preserve
the valid information I supplied and correct only the structural, calculation and consistency
problems.
